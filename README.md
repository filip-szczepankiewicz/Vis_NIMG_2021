### Content
This repository contains a framework for super-resolution reconstruction, i.e. reconstructing a high-resolution image from multiple low-resolution images. Examples are given for a numerical Shepp-logan phantom and phantom data acquired on a Siemens Prisma 3T.

### Dependencies
The code depends on https://github.com/markus-nilsson/md-dmri.git and https://github.com/xiangruili/dicm2nii.git.
